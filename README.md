# Handwriting-recognition

### Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning

A machine undergoing supervised learning has 'correct' outputs for each input, and is trained to generate the specific output to a minimal degree of error.
On the other hand, a machine undergoing unsupervised learning does not have correct outputs for the inputs. The machine is thus trained to generate plausible outputs for each individual output.

### Image classification

Image classification is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories.

### Handwriting recognition

The ability of a computer to interpret handwritings from texts, such as photographs, paper texts, or pdfs. The computer is able to find the most plausible words for a given text with unclear words. (write more about the specific task of the Kaggle competition, like what is the input/output, the specific problem formulation and evaluation metric)
